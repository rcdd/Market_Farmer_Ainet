Founded in 1994, Urban Harvest has garnered a well-deserved reputation as a leader in the local food movement. We've earned this role by adhering to clear and simple values and a focused mission:

Urban Harvest encourages community, good nutrition and sustainability through the teaching and support of organic gardening.

Under the direction of an all-volunteer board, Urban Harvest has grown from humble beginnings to employ a full-time staff and literally thousands of volunteers. Funding comes from nearly 1,500 annual memberships, and from individual and corporate donations, private foundations, and public grants.
